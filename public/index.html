      <p>Here you can enter anything you want and it will render on this page for anyone that visits.</p>
      <h3>What happens if I type HTML?</h3>
      <p>Go for it. That's the whole point.</p>
      <h3>What about style tags?</h3>
      <p>Please do.</p>
      <h3>Even script tags?</h3>
      <p>Absolutely. I've even gone ahead and included jQuery in there to help you along.</p>
      <h3>Service workers?</h3>
      <p>If you know how!</p>
      <h3>Isn't this a hugely irresponsible security problem?</h3>
      <p>Oh yeah, totally. Let's be clear, this is the worst idea I've ever had and nobody should ever use it. But it'll start clearing out random contributions once it gets crowded so feel free to break everything. I don't give a fuck.</p>
